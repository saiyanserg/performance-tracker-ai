# Performance Tracker with AI “Tip of the Day”

A full-stack app that lets you log daily sales entries, view summary statistics, and receive a one‐line sales tip generated by OpenAI (with a built-in fallback if the AI call fails).

---

## Features

- **Form & LocalStorage**  
  Enter date, lines, accessories, protection, and revenue. Entries persist across page reloads and are stored in `localStorage`.

- **Summary Statistics**  
  Automatically calculates total and average values for lines, accessories, protection, and revenue.

- **Tip of the Day**  
  Posts the entries array to an Express endpoint (`/api/generateTip`). The server calls OpenAI’s Chat Completion API (`gpt-3.5-turbo`) to generate a concise, one-line sales tip. If the AI call fails (rate limit, invalid key, insufficient quota), the server returns a static fallback tip instead of an error.

- **Responsive Table**  
  Displays all entries in a scrollable, styled table with alternating row backgrounds.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 16.x  
- npm (or yarn)  
- An OpenAI account with an API key and a small spending limit (e.g., \$5) to generate tips

---

## Environment Variables

1. In the `/server` folder, create a file named `.env`.
2. Add exactly one line (no quotes, no extra spaces):

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX


Replace `sk-…` with your actual OpenAI secret key. This key must have permission to call Chat Completion (`gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613`).
